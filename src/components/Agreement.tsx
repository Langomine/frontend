                        <p>
                            Langomine is a beta platform that analyzes your uploaded voice files to help you improve your English, but results are not guaranteed to be accurate. After processing, you can delete your voice file, though the analyzed data will be retained for system improvement. The service is free for now, but we donâ€™t guarantee uptime, performance, or accuracy. We use cookies and external services like Google Analytics to enhance user experience and track data. While we take steps to protect your data, we can't guarantee absolute security.
                        </p>

                        <h3>1.1 General</h3>
                        <p>Langomine is a language testing platform currently in <strong>beta</strong>. By using this
                            service, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

                        <h3>1.2 Purpose</h3>
                        <p>Langomine analyzes uploaded voice files to provide English language scoring. The results are
                            intended to help you learn more efficiently by identifying areas of improvement. However,
                            the results are <strong>not guaranteed</strong> to be accurate and should not be considered
                            as a formal rating system.</p>

                        <h3>1.3 Beta Disclaimer</h3>
                        <p>As Langomine is in <strong>beta</strong>, the platform may have bugs, inaccuracies, or

                            accuracy. The service is provided as-is and may be unavailable at times due to maintenance,
                            technical issues, or other reasons. We do not provide warranties for the service's
